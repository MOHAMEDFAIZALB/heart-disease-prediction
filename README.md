Heart disease can be predicted using a variety of techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence: 
 
Machine learning
Machine learning can be used to analyze patient data and predict heart disease. For example, one study used a self-attention-based transformer model to predict CVD risk and achieved an accuracy of 96.51%. Another study used the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, which is effective at disease prediction because it works with a single instance. 
 
Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence techniques like logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) can be used to analyze patient data and predict heart disease. For example, one study used random forest to predict heart disease and achieved an accuracy rate of 90%. 
 
Quantum-enhanced machine learning
Quantum-enhanced machine learning (QuEML) approaches can outperform traditional machine-learning approaches in terms of accuracy and computational time. However, QuEML poses several practical challenges, such as the risk of losing stored data due to heat and light. 
 
Heart disease risk factors include:
Age
Sex assigned at birth
Family history
Smoking
Unhealthy diet
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Diabetes
